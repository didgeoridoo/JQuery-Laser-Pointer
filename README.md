Dependencies: Tested with jQuery 1.7.2

Description:
This small plugin causes a "laser" of user-defined thickness, opacity and color to follow the cursor around the browser screen.

To use, include an HTML element with ID='laser'; this will be the origin of the beam.

The CSS position of the #laser element must be set to 'absolute' for the beam to track properly.
