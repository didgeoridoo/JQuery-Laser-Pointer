<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This small plugin causes a "laser" of user-defined thickness, opacity and color to follow the cursor around the browser screen.</p>

<p>To use, include an HTML element with ID='laser'; this will be the origin of the beam.</p>

<p>The CSS position of the #laser element must be set to 'absolute' for the beam to track properly.</p>

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

<h3>Q: Why?</h3>
<p>A: Because it's fun, I don't know. Think of the possibilities!</p>

<h3>Q: I notice you don't use it at all on your own site.</h3>
<p>A: That's because it's tacky as all hell, wildly distracting, and... hey, that wasn't a question! Get out of my FAQ section.</p>
